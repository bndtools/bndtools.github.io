summary: A short video showing the emulator and the train used during the OSGi CE 2015 IoT Contest

At the OSGi CE 2015 at the EclipseCon in Ludwigsburg, Germany, the OSGi Alliance held an IoT contest. Using OSGi enRoute, contestants could use an SDK to write either a Train or Track Manager. These bundles could be tested with a software emulator. During the Community Event, the Alliance installed an actual Lego train that was controlled by a cloud server and multiple Raspberry Pi's. The winner was Ghislain Nadeau and it is his bundle controlling the train in the video. Congratulations!

We are planning to move the contest [SDK to a tutorial][1].
