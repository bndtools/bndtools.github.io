The Eclipse Communication Framework released [ECF 3.15.5](https://github.com/eclipse/ecf) containing new tooling based upon Bndtools 7.1, 
that simplifies the project creation, development, debugging, and testing of OSGi Remote Services.

Simplification is provided through the use of Bndtools Workspace, Project, and Bndrun templates, the addition of OSGi Service wizards specifically for creating Remote Service api, impl, and consumer projects with a single wizard, 
generated bndrun files to allow immediate run/debug of wizard-created projects, the use of bndtools repos for dependencies, and new Eclipse views to support a) the discovery of EndpointDescriptions, and b) runtime inspection and management of the Remote Service Admin service.
