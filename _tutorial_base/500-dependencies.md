## What You Will Learn in This Section

In this section we look into how we can depend on other projects inside and outside our workspace. 
We introduce the _build path_ and the repositories that come with your workspace.

## External Dependency

There is a lot of code that we're proud of but the `EvalImpl` class is not really 
one of them. To preserve our pride we could of course spent a couple of weeks and 
come with a new evaluator but why invent the wheel when large groups have already 
done that already untold times and make it amazingly gratis available for you?

However, that raises the question how to get this external dependency in in our 
build? Well, we should first search in our local repositories. At the left bottom 
of your Eclipse window there are is a list of repositories:

![Repositories](/img/tutorial_base/dependencies-repo-0.png)

Now there is a simple parser on Maven central that is quite nice for our purpose: [PARSII][1] 
and has an MIT License. Would it not be nice if we could easily add this to our build 
path? So why not search for `PARSII` in the repositories view.

This comes up empty. What do we do? Well, we can search on [search.maven.org](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cparsii)

![Search on Maven](/img/tutorial_base/dependencies-search-0.png)

If we click on the version, we get the following window

![Search on Maven](/img/tutorial_base/dependencies-search-1.png)

We should now copy to the clip-board the Apache Maven dependency XML element.

	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.scireum</groupId>
	    <artifactId>parsii</artifactId>
	    <version>2.3</version>
	</dependency>

If look in the cnf folder then we see a file called `central.xml`. Double click on this
file and add the element coped to the clip board  into the `dependencies` element.

	<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
		<modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
	
		<groupId>local</groupId>
		<artifactId>central</artifactId>
		<version>0.0.0</version>
	
		<packaging>pom</packaging>
	
		<dependencies>
			<dependency>
				<groupId>com.scireum</groupId>
				<artifactId>parsii</artifactId>
				<version>2.3</version>
			</dependency>
		</dependencies>
	
	</project>

Unfortunately the refresh has a bug. To see the dependency, you must for now  
make small change to the `build.bnd` file in `cnf` project. This will kick
the repository to properly refresh itself.
{: .bug }

The repositories view is now updated and should look like:

![Search on Maven](/img/tutorial_base/dependencies-search-2.png)

	
## Adding to Build Path

We should first open the `bnd.bnd` file in the `com.acme.prime.eval.provider`
project and open the `Build` tab.


![Search on Maven](/img/tutorial_base/dependencies-build-0.png)

You can now drag the `com.scireum:parsii` entry and drop it on the build path, the
list with `osgi.enroute.base.api`. After you save the `bnd.bnd` file then the
Eclipse class path is automatically updated. 

![Search on Maven](/img/tutorial_base/dependencies-build-1.png)

## Updating the EvalImpl class

Since now have the PARSII library on our build path, we can use it in our `EvalImpl` class. 
This small library significantly simplifies our code:

	@Component(
		name = "com.acme.prime.eval.simple", 
		property = {
			Debug.COMMAND_SCOPE + "=test", 
			Debug.COMMAND_FUNCTION + "=eval" 
		}
	)
	public class EvalImpl implements Eval {
		@Override
		public double eval(String expression) throws Exception {
			return Parser.parse(expression).evaluate();
		}	
	}

When we save this class we suddenly get an error from the Eclipse console, s
omething like: 'could not resolve ...'. The big grey window that is yelling at 
you might be a bit annoying at first but we often went on a wild goose chase 
because we did not see the error in the console. 

In retrospect we could have expected this error since we created an external 
dependency in our source which was satisfied by the build path but we did not 
add anything to the runtime.

## Packaging

Back to the black art of packaging. Let's see how our bundle is shaping up: 
click on `bnd.bnd` and then select the `Contents` tab. It is clear that this 
bundle cannot resolve because it imports the `parsii.eval` package; a package 
for which the runtime has no providing bundle.

![Importing parsii](/img/tutorial_base/dependencies-pack-0.png)

The bundle therefore looks like:

![Importing parsii](/img/tutorial_base/dependencies-pack-1.png)

We now have 2 options. We can add the PARSII bundle to the runtime or we can add 
the imported packages to our own bundle. What is best? In this case the answer is quite easy 
since the PARSII is actually not a bundle; it is only a simple JAR. You can verify 
this easily. Select the PARSII bundle in the respositories view under the Central 
repository (search for parsii). If you double click on the JAR it opens the 
JAR Viewer, and the manifest is shown. 

![Importing parsii](/img/tutorial_base/dependencies-pack-5.png)


This rather meager manifest is not an OSGi manifest, ergo, this is not a bundle. 
So option 2, adding the packages to  the JAR is the best solution.

Go back to the `Contents` tab of the provider bundle. If you now drag the 
`parsii.eval` package from the Imported Packages list to the Private 
Packages list and save the `bnd.bnd` file then you see that a new import 
replaces the the `parsii.eval` package: `parsii.tokenizer`. You can now also 
drag this package to the Private Packages list but lets learn something new.

Adding these packages by hand can become tedious. So select the `Source` tab of the `bnd.bnd` editor:

![Importing parsii](/img/tutorial_base/dependencies-pack-2.png)

What you now see is the underlying `bnd.bnd` properties file; in bnd everything is a property! We can now replace the clause in the `Private-Package` header and use wildcards like `parsii.*`:

	Private-Package:  \
		com.acme.prime.eval.provider,\
		parsii.*

If you now save the `bnd.bnd` file and select the `Contents` tab you see that the imports have disappeared. Our provider bundle now looks like:

![Importing parsii](/img/tutorial_base/dependencies-pack-3.png)

Copying packages into your bundle from the class path often creates surprise, disgust and vomiting for the more traditional developers. For now you have to believe us that we do know why we break this taboo. it actually works quite well.

## Playing

Since there are now no longer any errors, we can now use our Gogo shell command to test out our efforts. We're now no longer restricted by a single operation so can go wild and find answers to all the (mathematical) questions we always wanted to know but were afraid to ask:

	g! test:eval pi
	3.141592653589793
	g! test:eval sin(pi)
	1.2246467991473532E-16
	g! test:eval sin(1)*sin(1)+cos(1)*cos(1)
	1.0
{: .shell }
	
There is a small chance that you did something different and that the you do not get the prompt. In that case, terminate the running process, goto the Run tab on the `bnd.bnd` file, and click `Run OSGi` again. If this does not resolve the issue, try the next step since this will add some debugging.

Otherwise, you can try the [Forum](/forum.html) and look for a good (technically educated) Samaritan to help you out.

## How Does it Work?

The basic dependency model of bnd is based on the OSGi Bundle Symbolic Name (BSN). The Build Path, the Run Bundle and a number of other paths and bundles all specify their dependency on an OGSi bundle by declaring a BSN and an version range. These specifications are translated into actual JARs on the file system through _repositories_. A repository takes a request for a BSN and provides bnd with the versions available for that BSN, and can turn an actual BSN and version into a file. Repositories are _plugins_, that is they are not an intrinsic part of bnd. It is actually quite easy to write a repository that links to some external repository. The repositories that are loaded are visible in the repositories view in the left bottom.

In the enRoute project we have the following repositories:

* Workspace – The workspace repository represents all the bundles in the workspace built by projects. You can add such bundles as a dependency to your project.
* Release – This is the repository where our final bundles are released in, you can find the storage of this repo in ./cnf/release
* Central (Maven) – This is a view on the Maven Central repository through a POM. You can find this file in `./cnf/central.xml`.


We then added the packages from PARSII to our own bundle because the PARSII JAR was not a bundle. We could have 
turned it into a bundle, but copying the classes in your own bundle is ok as long as they are copied to the 
Private Package area. Private classes are never exposed to the outside and can not conflict with other bundles. 
It is important that you make sure none of the objects is in the public API in one of the exported packages. 
That is, if the Eval interface had a reference to for example the `parsii.eval.Parsers` class then we could not a
dd the packages from PARSII to our own bundle; it could cause really nasty OSGi errors. In general, bnd will notify 
you when that happens. In this case we're ok since the PARSII JAR is fully encapsulated in our bundle.
