<h2>Discuss</h2>
<p>
	Bndtools and bnd use a combined <a
		href="https://bnd.discourse.group">forum / discussion group on Discourse</a>. We encourage general discussion about
	all topics related to building with Bndtools or bnd, including the
	use of the <a
		href="https://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-maven-bundle-plugin-bnd.html">Maven
		Bundle Plugin</a> (which uses bnd internally) or the <a
		href="https://bnd.bndtools.org/chapters/200-components.html">bnd annotations for
		Declarative Services</a>.

<h2>Report Issues</h2>
<p>
	Bndtools is <a href="https://github.com/bndtools/bnd">hosted
		at GitHub</a> and we use the <a
		href="https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/issues">GitHub issue
		tracker</a> system as our principle bug reporting system. If you have
	found a problem please let us know!
</p>
<p>
	<b>Note:</b> when you report an issue, please make sure to report the
	Git descriptors of the Bndtools that you are using. These descriptors
	can be found in the manifests of the Bndtools JARs: just open one of
	the Bndtools JARs that are in your Eclipse plugins directory and
	copy&amp;paste the Git descriptor headers from its manifest. The
	headers you're looking for are
	<code>Git-Descriptor</code>
	and
	<code>Git-SHA</code>
	.
