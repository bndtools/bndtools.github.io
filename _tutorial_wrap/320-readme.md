We know, documenting is a pita ... However, you do appreciate it yourself when you don't have to guess yourself what a bundle does so why no spend 5 mins providing some proper documentation?

In each OSGi enRoute project you will find a `readme.md` file. It is strongly suggested that you edit this file and include it in the `-includeresource` instruction. An option of this instruction allows you to process any bnd macros. So lets add the following description in `readme.md`:

	# OSGI ENROUTE EXAMPLES WRAPPING DOM4J ADAPTER
	
	${Bundle-Description}

	This bundle was constructed from the following JARs:
	
		${-buildpath}
		
	Exports are: ${exports}
	
	You can find this project on https://github.com/osgi/osgi.enroute.examples/${p}
	
	This bundle is version ${versionmask;===;${Bundle-Version}} and was build on ${tstamp}
	
	

To pre-process this file for macros, add curly braces ('{' and '}') around the resource.

	-includeresource: \
		@pull-parser__pull-parser-2.1.10.jar!/PullParser*_VERSION, \
		@pull-parser__pull-parser-2.1.10.jar!/META-INF/services/*, \
		tosc-license.txt, \
		{readme.md}
