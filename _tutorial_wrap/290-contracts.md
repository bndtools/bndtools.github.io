This is an advanced subject.

One possibility for the versioning problem in the previous section is to use _OSGi contracts_. An OSGi contract replaces the versions on the myriad packages with a single versioned name. This was concept was developed because the versions on servlet related packages was a disaster. This is outlined in [135.3 osgi.contract Namespace].

Providing a contract is quite straightforward, you provide a capability that enumerates the packages that belong to the contract. The users of the bundle should then have a matching requireme capability. (bnd has support then to remove the versions from the package import, read [135.3 osgi.contract Namespace] for more information.)

The capability that we provide for the contract must contain the list of packages in the `uses:` directive. Fortunately, the `${exports}` macro contains the list of all our exported packages in bnd. Saves us from maintaining this list by hand. So the capability would look like: 

	Provide-Capability: \
	  ... \
	  osgi.contract; \
	    osgi.contract=DOM4J; \
	    uses:="${exports}"; \
	    version:List<Version>=1.0.0

There is a bug in the OSGi specification, it lists `version=1.0.0` but it should be `version:List<Version>=1.0.0`.
{:.bug}

The bundles that use this DOM4J contract should now have a matching require capability like:

	Require-Capability: \
	  ... \
	  osgi.contract; \
        filter:="(&(osgi.contract=DOM4J)(version=1.0))"
	-contract: DOM4J

The `-contract` instruction tells bnd to remove the versions of all packages that are part of the contract.
