![Chat Service](/img/tutorial_rsa/overview-distributing.png)

## Application

We now need to create an environment in which our Chat provider can run. Obviously, since we want to demonstrate distributed OSGi, we should then provide an environment with distribution, using the Zookeeper server we started in the previous section.
 
We provide this environment in an application project. We therefore neeed to create a new Bndtools project called `osgi.enroute.examples.chat.application`. Please use your own name, but the suffix must be `.application`.

Go ahead and create it.

This creates a simple Angular based application using a REST backend. We'll ignore the GUI for now, this is saved for last.

In the runtime we need the following roles:

* A Distribution provider
* A Topology Manager
* A Discovery model

The OSGi enRoute distro does not contain the Zookeeper discovery bundle. Unfortunately, this bundle is not on Maven Central. You can find it here https://repository.amdatu.org/release/org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper/. You can drag the URL to the latest version on the `Local` repository in the Bndtools Repository view. This will store the bundle in your cnf/local folder and make it available to bnd.

Then click on the `osgi.enroute.examples.chat.bndrun` file and select the `Run` tab. 

The application bundle should already be there, if not add it.

From the list of `Available Bundles` add the `org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper` bundle. You could also add the `org.amdatu.remote.admin.http` and `org.amdatu.remote.topology.promiscuous` bundles but if you do not have other distribution providers in your distro then the Zookeeper bundle should suffice. 

Also add our Chat client (`osgi.enroute.examples.chat.provider`) to the list if `Run Requirements`. We do not want to leave this crucial bundle out!

Resolve, save.

## Configuring

We need to configure the Amdatu Distribution provider. We could do this by hand like we did for the `user.name` of the Chat service but the configuration for the Zookeeper discoverer is rather extensive and uses really long names. So we use the standard configuration facility of an OSGi enRoute applications.

In OSGi enRoute we have the _Configurer Extender_. This is a bundle that watches a special file in other bundles, the `configuration/configuration.json` file. If this file is present, it wil parse it and turn the records in there in OSGi Configuration Admin configurations. 

If you look in the `ChatApplication` class then you'll see that we require the Configurer Extender there with the `@RequireConfigurerExtender` annotation.

 
So all we need to do is to add our configuration to this `configuration/configuration.json` file:

	[
	  {
	    "service.pid":"org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.connectstring"
	       : "localhost:6789",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.host"
	       :"localhost",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.rootpath"
	       :"/rsa",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.path"
	       : "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.schedule"
	       : 10
	  }
	] 

## Debugging

We could start the `osgi.enroute.examples.chat.bndrun` file but then we do not get Gogo nor Xray. So let's instead use the `debug.bndrun`. This bndrun file inherits the settings of the `osgi.enroute.examples.chat.bndrun` file but adds a set of bundles like XRay and Gogo to make the life of a debugger less horrible.

So double click `osgi.enroute.examples.chat.bndrun` and select the `Run` tab. Resolve, save, and click on the `Debug` button.

## Zookeeper

You now should have two frameworks running:

* `debug.bndrun` – The application on [http://localhost:8080][lh]
* `zk.bndrun` – A Zookeeper server running on port `localhost:6789`

This might require some shuffling of consoles.

You could check the logs to see if there were no issues: [http://localhost:8080/system/console/logs](http://localhost:8080/system/console/logs)

You might want to check the Gogo shell commands:

	g! members
	osgi
{: .shell}
	
On the Zookeeper console we could check if there is a node created. We configured the Zookeeper Configurer to use a root node `/rsa`.

	g! zk:ls /
	zookeeper
	rsa
	g! zk:ls /rsa
	80082c04-927d-0015-12ef-f924e90c7d18
	g! data /rsa/80082c04-927d-0015-12ef-f924e90c7d18
	http://localhost:8080/org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper/
{: .shell }

Obviously _your_ unreadable numbers will look different.

## Exporting

We'll update our Chat service to be exported. We can do this because the Chat service is properly designed for distribution. The only data types we're using are String and Message. Message is a DTO and they are explicitly designed to be serialized.

So the only thing we have to do is add the magic property to our `ChatImpl` class.

```java
@Designate(ocd=Configuration.class, factory=false)
@Component(
	name = "osgi.enroute.examples.chat", 
	property = {
		"user.name=osgi",
^
		"service.exported.interfaces=*"
^
	}
)
public class ChatImpl implements Chat {
	
	@Override
	public boolean send(Message message) throws Exception {
		System.out.printf("%s: %s%n", message.from, message.text);
		return true;
	}

}
```

The results are rather underwhelming, nothing happens. 

## Cluster
We now need to get the cluster up and running. You should make sure that you have no frameworks running and then select one of the following options.

### With a Presenter

It this tutorial is given by a presenter then he will provide you with an IP number to his machine. If the presenter's IP number is  172.16.8.8 and your IP number is 172.16.8.42 then your `configuration/configuration.json` should look like:

	[
	  {
	    "service.pid":"org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.connectstring": 
	                "172.16.8.8:6789",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.host":
	                "172.16.8.42",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.rootpath":"/rsa",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.path":
	                 "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.schedule":10
	  }
	] 

You can then just start `debug.bndrun`. The application will contact the presenter's Zookeeper and will from there find its peers.

### If You Have Friends

If you have some nearby friends then it is now easy even more easy to share than on Facebook.  

Assuming you're the primary and you're on IP address 172.16.8.8. This will be the Zookeeper connect address to use for everybody (`"org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.connectstring`). The `"org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.host"`, however, must be set to your machine's IP number. Your configuration therefore looks like:

	[
	  {
	    "service.pid":"org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.connectstring": 
	                "172.16.8.8:6789",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.host":
	                "172.16.8.8",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.rootpath":"/rsa",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.path":
	                 "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.schedule":10
	  }
	] 

The primary must also ensure that it has a running Zookeeper. That is, it should run the `zk.bndrun` file we prepared earlier.

So one of your friends that has IP address 172.16.8.42 then he should configure like:

	[
	  {
	    "service.pid":"org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.connectstring": 
	                "172.16.8.8:6789",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.host":
	                "172.16.8.42",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.rootpath":"/rsa",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.path":
	                 "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper",
	    "org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper.schedule":10
	  }
	] 

Each of you can then just start `debug.bndrun`. The primary will contact its local Zookeeper; the secondaries will contact the primary Zookeeper and will from there find its peers.

### If You Don't Have Friends

You should first make sure that you got one Zookeeper running. If there are no Zookeepers, run the `zk.bndrun` file.

You should also ensure that you got the `debug.bndrun` console, otherwise Run this file.


To see distributed OSGi work without friends we need to have at least two different frameworks and a Zookeeper. We can start a second framework but we cannot use the same `debug.bndrun` file because this would use the same storage area and same HTTP port. So we need to clone this `debug.bndrun` file. 

Therefore, make a copy of this file and call it `debug-alt.bndrun`.


In this file we need to set a different storage area and ensure that we have a different HTTP port:

	-include:               ~osgi.enroute.examples.chat.bndrun
	-runrequires.debug:     ${debug-bundles}
	-runstorage:            generated/fw-alt
	-runtrace:              true
	-runproperties:         org.osgi.service.http.port=8081

**Note:** Earlier workspaces set the `org.osgi.service.http.port` property in such a way that it could not be overridden. You might want to check the `cnf/ext/enroute-distro.bnd` file. It should not contain the the property. If it does, remove it. 

We don't have to change the configuration, the default configuration works fine for both running frameworks. Just through the Web Console change the name of the local user so it will not be the same for the second framework we start.

You now need to Resolve the `debug-alt.bndrun` file and save it. Then click on the `Debug` button to start it.

Ok, you should now have three Frameworks running simultaneously in three different consoles!

* `debug.bndrun` – The application on [http://localhost:8080][lh]
* `debug-alt.bndrun` – The application on [http://localhost:8081][lh1]
* `zk.bndrun` – A Zookeeper server running on port `localhost:6789`

We need to change the name of the user for each framework since we use a Map to store the Chat services. If we use the same name on both frameworks they will not be able to discriminate between them. So go to [http://localhost:8081/system/console/configMgr](http://localhost:8081/system/console/configMgr) and select the Chat provider configuration. Set the `user.name` to something like `alternate`. 

The two different runs can share the same `configuration/configuration.json` because we do not specify the port in there, the Amdatu Zookeeper discovery code will automatically detect on which port the HTTP server is running and use that one. You can verify that by going to the `zk.bndrun` console and checking the content of the `/rsa/*` nodes. It should now have 2 entries in the `/rsa` node. One for each framework.

	g! zk:ls /rsa
	508a414b-2e7e-0015-1276-b3915cbaf5a9
	8050ba54-2e7e-0015-11c3-f08c767af334
	g! data /rsa/508a414b-2e7e-0015-1276-b3915cbaf5a9
	http://0.0.0.0:8080/org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper/
	g! data /rsa/8050ba54-2e7e-0015-11c3-f08c767af334
	http://localhost:8081/org.amdatu.remote.discovery.zookeeper/
{: .shell}

Again, your number may vary (we hope).

## Running

You should now be able to see the members:

	g! members
	osgi
	alternate
{: .shell}

You can now talk to them through the OSGi Chat command! In the primary console (`debug.bndrun`)  our name is the default `osgi` name since we did not set the configuration. So from this console: 

	g! send osgi alternate "You should change your name!"
	true
	osgi: What name?
	g! send osgi alternate "Ah forget it!"
{: .shell}

Don't wait too long for `alternate` to reply, you'll have to do that yourself in the `debug-alt.bndrun` console.

## Notes

This Zookeeper server runs in standalone mode. This is fine for testing but to make this work in an actual cluster it should be replicated.
