## Enhancements

* Bndtools is built to run on Eclipse 2018-12 or later. So Bndtools 5.0 may not run on older versions of Eclipse.
* Added a Bndtools Explorer view with a search bar. This can be used to show projects whose name matches the search bar value.

For Bnd changes, see <https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/wiki/Changes-in-5.0.0>.

## Known Issues

* None at this time.
