The OSGi Summit as part of the OCX 2024 (the new open source conference hosted by the Eclipse Foundation) will take place on 22 October 2024 in Mainz, Germany.

It is an opportunity for users, integrators and implementors of OSGi technology to come together. Discussions will cover recent and upcoming specification enhancements, novel and interesting uses of OSGi technology, and detailed journeys into the tools and libraries that can be used to realise your applications.

There will be lots of interesting talks about OSGi and also one talk about the new features of the upcoming 7.1.0 Release of Bndtools.
Looking forward to see you.
