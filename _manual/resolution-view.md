To see the requirements and capabilities of a bundle Bndtools has a special Resolution view. This shows the requirements and capabilities of a selected JAR file or a `bnd.bnd` file.

More information can be found in the manual at [Resolving Dependencies](https://bnd.bndtools.org/chapters/250-resolving.html).
