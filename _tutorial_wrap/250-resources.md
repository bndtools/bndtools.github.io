title: Resources 
summary: When the target bundle uses resources, like translations, these should also be copied with the -includeresource instruction.

JARs are extremely flexible, they can contain any type of resource. So far, we've only focused on packages. However, we can also copy resources from the JARs on our `-buildpath` (or file system) into our target JAR.

The `pull-parser__pull-parser-2.1.10.jar` contains an (empty) file in the root of the JAR named `PullParser2.1.10_VERSION`. You can see that resource from the `Bnd Bundle Path` container. Maybe the parser assumes this resource in its root so we better make sure it is included. To include resources from the `-buildpath` or file system we use the `-includeresource` instruction.

	-includeresource: \
		@pull-parser__pull-parser-2.1.10.jar!/PullParser*_VERSION

The `-includeresource` instruction can take any resources from the file system but it has a nifty feature to also use resources from the `-buildpath`. If you prefix a resource with `@` then it will assume a JAR file. It will first look on the file system but if it is not there, it will look for that file name (not path) in the `-buildpath`. You could include the whole JAR but with the `!/` pattern you can single out a resource. (This is standard for JAR URLs.) The resource will then be copied to the same path in the target bundle. 

And as usual in bnd, you can use a wildcard character '*' to not hardcode the version number.

You can verify that the resource made it in the JAR Editor.
